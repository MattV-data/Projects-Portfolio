# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of my data science projects. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

[TorontoRentals webscraping](https://github.com/MattV-data/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Webscraping%20TorontoRentals%20portfolio.ipynb)

This project uses condo listing info from TorontoRentals.com. The project is focused on 
analysing monthly rental cost with square footage in the various boroughs of Toronto.


[Fraud Detection](https://github.com/MattV-data/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection%20portfolio.ipynb)

This project looks into helping lay the foundation for RTR (real time rail) payment systems. Using a sample dataset,
a model was built to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The model is to be evaluated using the area
under the ROC curve.
