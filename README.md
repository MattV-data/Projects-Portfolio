# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of my data science projects. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

[TorontoRentals webscraping](https://github.com/MattV-data/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Webscraping%20TorontoRentals%20portfolio.ipynb)

This project uses condo listing info from TorontoRentals.com. The project is focused on 
analysing monthly rental cost with square footage in the various boroughs of Toronto.


Tools

* Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Beautiful Soup


[Fraud Detection](https://github.com/MattV-data/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection%20portfolio.ipynb)

This project looks into helping lay the foundation for RTR (real time rail) payment systems. Using a sample dataset,
a model was built to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The model is evaluated using the area
under the ROC curve.


Tools

* Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn


[House Cost Analysis & Prediction](https://github.com/MattV-data/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Housing%20Portfolio%20Project.ipynb)

This project analyzes the cost of homes from a Melbourne realty dataset and creates a price prediction model.


Tools

* Python: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn


[Uber Weather Analysis](https://github.com/MattV-data/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Uber%20Weather%20Analysis%20Portfolio.ipynb)

Query Uber ride and weather data stored on geo-coordinates, prepared multiple dashboards & story to study impact of weather on uber ridership and utilized Time Series analysis in Python.


Tools

* Python: Pandas
